	<p>The goal of this assignment is to develop an optimizer that
	performs dataflow analysis and scalar optimizations. This assignment
	has the following components:
	<ol>
		<li>Construct the Control Flow Graph (CFG). (5%)</li>
		<li>Perform Strongly Connected Region (SCR) analysis. (5%)</li>
		<li>Perform reaching definitions (20%) and use it to perform
		simple constant propagation. (25%)</li>
		<li>Perform live variable analysis (20%) and use it to perform
		dead statement elimination. (25%)</li>
		<li>Extra credit: perform constant propagation with the Wegman &
		Zadeck algorithm. (+15%)</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font
		size=4 color="#330066"> Project Description </font></font></b>
	<p>You will add this functionality to the translator you implemented
	for the Lab 1. Your compiler will call the csc compiler to compile a C
	subset file named as &lt;filename.c&gt;. The optimizer will take
	3-address format code as input, perform the analysis and
	optimizations on it, and generate optimized 3-address format code as
	output. The last step of your optimizer will convert this 3-address
	form to C, using your translator from Lab 1.

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Download the example C files and the CFG output at <A
			HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/380C/labs/cs380c_lab2.tgz">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/380C/labs/cs380c_lab2.tgz</A></li>

		<li>Decompress the file on the cs unix machines using
<pre>
	&quot;tar xvfz cs380c_lab2.tgz&quot;.
</pre>
		This command will produce the following directory structure
<pre>
	cs380c_lab2
		examples
		lab2
</pre> 
		The examples directory contains 10 example c files named as &lt;filename.c&gt;,
		and their CFG output named &lt;filename.ta.cfg&gt;, and two
		bash scripts (check.sh, check-one-cfg.sh). Many of these are the same as in Lab 1. 
		You can use the provided files to verify your implementation. 
		</li>

		<li>Implement your own optimizer in the lab2 directory. Your
		compiler should accept 3-address code as input from stdin and write
		output to stdout. Your compiler backend should generate the following
		output:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>CFG</li>
			<li>3-address code - a backend that prints out your optimized
			(or unoptimized) 3-address format</li>
			<li>C - functionality from Lab 1</li>
			<li>An optimization report</li>
		</ol>

		<p></p>
		Your compiler will be invoked by the script <tt><b>run.sh'</b></tt> and should accept
		the following command line arguments.
		<ol type="a">
			<li><tt><b>-opt</b></tt>, a comma separated list of optimizations: <tt><b>scp</b></tt> (Simple
			Constant Propagation), <tt><b>dse</b></tt> (Dead Statement Elimination) and <tt><b>wcp</b></tt>
			(Wegman/Zadeck Constant Propagation)
			<li><tt><b>-backend</b></tt>, specifies the particular code generator: <tt><b>c</b></tt>, <tt><b>cfg</b></tt>,
			<tt><b>3addr</b></tt>, and <tt><b>rep</b></tt> (the optimization report)
		</ol>

		<p></p>
		Here are some usage examples.
		<ol type="a">
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -backend=c</b></tt> # This is lab 1</li>
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -backend=cfg</b></tt> # Part 1 of lab 2</li>
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -opt=scp -backend=3addr</b></tt> # Perform simple constant
			propagation and generate output in 3-address format.</li>
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -opt=wcp -backend=c</b></tt> # Perform Wegman constant
			propagation and produce C code as output.</li>
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -opt=scp -backend=cfg</b></tt> # Perform simple constant
			propagation and write out the cfg (after these optimizations)</li>
			<li><tt><b>./run.sh -opt=scp -backend=rep</b></tt> # Perform simple constant
			propagation and write out the optimization report (after these
			optimizations)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>

		<li>Verify your implementation.<br>
		Modify the scripts in example directory to check your own
		implementation</li>

		<li>Turn in your implementation.
		(See "Turning In Your Assignment" section for more details.)</li>

	</font></font></b>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Construct the Control Flow Graph (CFG).</b>
		Before performing iterative data-flow analysis, you will need
		to generate the CFG. The nodes of the CFG are the basic blocks. The
		basic blocks in turn consist of a sequence of instructions in
		3-address format.
		<p>Your implementation should print out the lead instruction's number
		as the basic block number. It also needs to print out the edges
		between the basic blocks.The following is the <b>expected</b>
		output for the gcd.c example:
<pre> 
	Function: 2
	Basic blocks: 2 3 5 14
	CFG:
	2 -> 3
	3 -> 5 14
	5 -> 3
	14 ->
	Function: 18
	Basic blocks: 18 30 46
	CFG:
	18 -> 30
	30 -> 46
	46 ->
</pre>
	 The output should be self-explanatory. The numbers are the instruction
		numbers that start the functions and basic blocks (leaders from the
		class lecture). The list of basic blocks and CFG successors should be
		sorted numerically. No optimization report is required for CFG
		generation.

		<p>For all programs in the examples directory, the CFGs expressed
		in the above format are given along with the source program. Before
		turning in your assignment, you should check whether your output
		matches these files. We will perform additional tests when grading,
		and recommend you use your test files from Lab 1 and others to check
		your code.
		</li>
		<li><b>Perform SCR analysis on the CFG.</b> Produce an optimization
		report in the following format:
<pre>
	Function: 2
	Basic blocks: 2 6 11 22
	SCR: 2 6 11
</pre></li>
		<li><b>Perform simple constant propagation based on reaching
		definitions.</b> You need to perform reaching definitions analysis and run
		a simple constant propagation analysis that determines if the
		reaching definitions to a variable are all the same constant. The execution time of
		the algorithm is not a criterion. Your analysis should converge and
		compute the correct results. You must report the
		number of constants which have been propagated.
		Produce an optimization report in the following format:
<pre>
	Function: 2
	Number of constants propagated: 3
	Function: 18
	Number of constants propagated: 6
</pre></li>

		<li><b>Perform dead statement elimination based on liveness analysis.</b>
		First perform liveness analysis and then use the result of the analysis to eliminate
		statements that produce a result that is not live. You must report the
		number of statements which have been eliminated. The statements in
		strongly connected regions (SCR) and those that are not in a SCR
		need to be counted separately.
		Produce optimization report in the following format:
<pre>
	Function: 2
	Number of statements eliminated in SCR: 1
	Number of statements eliminated not in SCR: 2
	Function: 18
	Number of statements eliminated in SCR: 2
	Number of statements eliminated not in SCR: 3
</pre></li>

		<li><b>Extra Credit.</b> Perform a more sophisticated constant
		propagation algorithm based on your own insights and/or Wegman &
		Zadeck, <a href=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103136>Constant
		Propagation with Conditional Branches</a>, ACM Transactions on Programming
		Languages and Systems, 13(2):181-210, April 1991. Report number of
		constants your algorithm propagates. Produce an optimization report
		with the same format as simple constant propagation.</li>

	<p>Your assignment should contain the following.
	<ol>
		<li>A single tar.gz file named lab2-group<span class="style2">X</span>.tgz 
		(X should be replaced by your group number), which, when extracted,
		creates the lab2 directory.
		<li>The lab2 directory can contain sub-directories.
		<li>The lab2 directory should contain the following files:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>README - Please include your name(s) and student ID(s).</li>
			<li>example-scp.c - a synthetic program that tests constant
			propagation.</li>
			<li>example-dse.c - a synthetic program that tests statement
			elimination.</li>
			<li>compile.sh - a script to compile your source code.</li>
			<li>run.sh - a script that runs your compiler. This script
			should read 3-address code as input from stdin and write the output to
			stdout. The output is specified by the command line arguments
			described above.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Turn in your assignment by emailing the final lab2-groupX.tgz to the 
	instructor.<pre>
