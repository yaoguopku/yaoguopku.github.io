<p style="width: 885px; "><font face="Times New Roman">
As the number of mobile apps keeps increasing, users often need to compare many apps, in order to choose one that best fits their needs. Fortunately, as there are so many users sharing an app market, it is likely that some other users with the same preferences already made the comparisons and shared their opinions. For example, a user may state that an app is better in power consumption than another app in a review, then the review would help other users who care about battery life while choosing apps.
</font></p>
<p style="width: 885px; "><font face="Times New Roman">
This project proposes a method to identify comparative reviews for mobile apps from an app market, which can be used to provide fine-grained app comparisons based on different topics. According to experiments on 5 million reviews from Google Play and manual assessments on 900 reviews, our method is able to identify opinions accurately and provide meaningful comparisons between apps, which could in turn help users find desired apps based on their preferences.

	process: We have done all the assessments with 9 different volunteers (who 
	are not authors) who are good in English and familiar with mobile apps. Each 
	piece of result is now labeled by 3 raters, and the majority opinion is 
	taken as the ground truth in our evaluation results. </span></li>
	<li class="style15" style="width: 840px"><span lang="zh-cn">In practice, we 
	have asked 6 raters to label whether a review is comparing two apps and 3 
	raters to label the topic and preference of the reviews. Each review is then 
	labeled three times, and in over 95% of the cases, all three raters agree 
	with each other. In the few cases when they do not agree, we take the 
	majority opinion. </span></li>
