abstract = {While in most countries, Google Play and Apple App Store
dominate, Chinese mobile phone users can choose among dozens of different
app markets, which differ greatly in the information presented. This makes
the Chinese mobile ecosystem a unique case study for investigating whether
users actively choose app markets that conform to their preferences. We
investigated this question in a survey of 200 Chinese users aged 18-49.
Scenarios covered apps that require disclosure of different types of
sensitive information (shopping, dating, health), with gaming as a baseline.
Users preferred markets that were easy to use and had a wide choice of apps.
Only nine users highlighted security as a feature. Despite this, they
primarily used only one app market - the pre-installed one. App-market
specific features were important for the game scenario, but less important
for all others. We suggest that download decisions for most apps are made
before users enter an app market, and discuss implications for presenting
privacy and security information.},
