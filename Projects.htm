<p><span lang="zh-cn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am particular interested in building 
new types of operating systems (OSs) for new types of IT systems and beyond. A 
new OS may be built on top of the current OSs such as Linux and Windows, however 
offering similar functionalities such as resource management, software 
development kits (SDKs) and libraries, as well as application development and 
runtime support. Examples includes:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Robot OS.</strong> Operating systems for new 
	robotic applications, such as robots and drones, especially for new 
	programming models, programming supporting tools and environment for 
	collective intelligence.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Brain-like OS</strong>. Operating systems for 
	brain-like computing, including new programming models, programming support 
	tools and compilers for new applications based on brain-like processor 
	chips.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Internetware OS</strong>. Operating systems 
	for Internetware, a new software paradigm for Internet computing. 
	Internetware OS includes a new set of OS that can be applied to new types of 
	applications and organizations. For example, we can build a new OS for a 
	smart object, a university campus, a smart city or an enterprise.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Intelligent OS. </strong>Future OS will 
	provide support for artificial intelligence (AI), while at the same time, AI 
	will be built into all future OSs. We will investigate the application needs 
	and design intelligent software development and runtime support.</span></li>

Quality Improvement of
Mobile Systems</span></font></p>
<p><span lang="zh-cn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been working on improving the 
quality of mobile applications and systems for edge devices such as smartphones 
and wearables. </span>&nbsp;<span lang="zh-cn">Examples include performance 
measurement and improvement, mobile app analysis, power models, energy analysis 
and energy optimization of mobile apps and mobile analysis, privacy and security 
of mobile apps and sysems, etc. In particular, I am interested in the following 
projects:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>&nbsp;Understanding mobile app privacy.</strong> 
	Help mobile users better understand why each mobile app uses sensitive 
	permissions, where it is used and why it is used. As many mobile apps do not 
	specify these detailed information, it is sometimes confusing to end-users 
	why these permissions are used. We have been trying different approaches to 
	help users understand the privacy implications of mobile apps. New 
	approaches and ideas are needed as this is one of the under-studied issues 
	in mobile security and privacy.</span></li>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Fine-grained privacy policies and access 
	control. </strong>One of our main goals is to invent better access control 
	methods for mobile users to better control their personal data.&nbsp; </span></li>
	<li><span lang="zh-cn"><strong>Power estimation based on static analysis</strong>: 
	Power and energy consumption is one of the everlasting issues for mobile 
	devices. Although many techniques have been proposed in this directions, it 
	is still difficult for a developer to understand how his/her app consumes 
	energy. We aim to invent a new method to help developers analyze the 
	power/energy consumption of their apps during the development phase.</span></li>
